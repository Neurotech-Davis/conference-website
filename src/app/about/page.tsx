                        The Second Annual California Neurotechnology Conference is coming to NorCal! 
                        The inaugural conference accomplished something unprecedented: a wide-reaching West Coast symposium dedicated to neurotechnology and catered toward college students. 
                        The 2024 conference will once again break beyond what has been done before, reaching wider and connecting more audiences. The conference will be live streamed for the first time, expanding its reach beyond the West Coast to engage participants worldwide. It will also branch out from its initial student-centered theme, bringing together professionals from industry and academia.
